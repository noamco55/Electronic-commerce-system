The Electronic System made by myself and Arye Varman for school as first object oriented project.


The trading system simulates a system that has sellers and buyers and allows you to do various of actions.
such as adding a product to seller or selecting a product for a buyer's shopping cart and etc.
all possible actions of the system are described in the interface file menu print function.
